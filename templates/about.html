          <h1>About Me</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-section">
          <p>Three years ago I made a decision to turn my life long interest and fascination in technology into a career. At that time I was working as an Assistant Manager at The Trailhead Restaurant in Estes Park, CO. I decided that to achieve my new found goals as efficiently as possible I should go back to school full time.</p>

          <p>I attended Chattahoochee Technical College majoring in Computer Information Systems Technology. I enjoyed my classes and I learned a lot while earning my degree and in the process I found my biggest passion in technology is in programming and development.</p>

          <p>After I graduated I decided to continue my education to gain all the skills I would need to become a Web Developer. After many hours of researching schools and programs all across the country I came to the conclusion that Epicodus located in Portland, OR was the best place for me. I felt that a program like Epicodus would prepare me for all of the technical and non technical skills I wanted to improve on such as working on team projects and pair programming.</p>

          <p>It turned out to be a great decision because I learned so many new things during my time at Epicodus. Iâ€™m also very happy living in Portland and in January of 2016 I started my technology career as a Software QA Analyst at <a href="http://www.plusqa.com" target="_blank" class="links">Plus QA</a>.</p>
